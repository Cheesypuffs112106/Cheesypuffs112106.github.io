          The only reason anyone would find themselves in Red Hook was if they were lost, walking the wrong way trying to get to Carroll Gardens, missing their turn on the BQE, or even going down the wrong road attempting to find the IKEA. As people approach Red Hook, they immediately know they're not where they were supposed to be going. Large beige project buildings flood the area, gathered groups of old men talking and laughing about the "good times" pop up on every corner, and a countless number of people hot-boxing their cars. But as you keep walking further, the environment changes. Suddenly, the projects are gone, and luxurious restaurants emerge on every corner. The hipsters now run the area with their long hair and peculiar glasses and attempt to show you that their music is the best.
          Nobody sees Red Hook for both sides of what it is. Every time someone asks me where I live, I have to prepare myself for the two only responses I get: "Damn, you're from the trenches" or "Oh, the nice place where Hometown barbeque is?". I never corrected them. I don't waste my time.

         My first memories of Red Hook weren't pleasant. I hated the place. All the stories about the magical city of New York, the city that never sleeps, but I'm greeted with dull, monotonous brick buildings and not a soul to be seen. Where were the bright lights, the massive skyscrapers, the moody people, the ongoing sirens? That was the  New York I craved. Yet I was standing there, fresh off a 12-hour flight, completely underwhelmed. But later, I began to understand that my idea of New York isn't Red Hook. I craved a fantasy—a delusion. Red Hook was never built to wow people. It isn't a place where you are immediately amazed. It takes a while. You'll find what the neighborhood truly is through your experiences. your first complimentary key lime pie and conversation with Steve, or a pickup basketball game at Coffey with the local 12-year-olds who insist on showing you their new celebration or your first-ever barnacle parade.
         But soon enough, you'll be sick of the Key Lime Pies, the young kids won't care about the celebrations anymore, and your favorite float at the barnacle parade won't be there. But the core of the red hook will never leave. The community and the things that matters will live on. Your relationship with Steve will always be there, and with each pie, you two become closer. The basketball courts will always be active, as will the kids; with each barnacle parade, you feel yourself becoming more and more a part of the community. The small things change, but the heart of Red Hook lives on through generations.

         Red Hook is in the middle of nowhere. Far away from everything. Not even the subways run here. People who don't live in Red Hook love to claim they know the place, but they don't. They know the nice pizza place by the pier where the posh park slope parents go to get away or the Ocky Way deli where teenagers take videos to compare to their favorite rapper. That's not a Red Hook anyone who lives here would recognize .
         Red Hook is weird. The environment is weird. The people are weird. Their clothes are weird. Their personalities are weird. I have met the oddest people through my time in Red Hook. Strange old men telling me they'd cook me if it wasn't for their knee, or the intimidating big bearded motorcyclists doing wheelies on the cobblestone pavement before going into a bar to listen to soft jazz, and the bald italian screaming at the top of his lungs in a thick accent taking your order. The list goes on and on with so many different types of people all in one area. The conflicting personalities all around you and wondering how everyone is able to fit in. There's no pressure living in Red Hook. Nobody is pretending to be anyone. Everyone is authentic. That's what creates the unique atmosphere. It’s original. It's not like anywhere else in New York. It's not like Midtown, where your next-door neighbor is a Home Depot or like SoHo where everyone dresses the same, talks the same and has the same goals. People are able to value each other's differences in Red Hook. It brings them together. Different cultures and different backgrounds are able to share an environment where they create new experiences and are able to be themselves. My first couple of years in New York were difficult. Constantly adapting to fit in. All I wanted was to be cool enough to play football with the prospect park kids and funny enough to ride the train with the Harlem kids. The constant pressure to be what people wanted. But Red Hook was always there for me. I never had to change for Red Hook and I was able to find myself even when I was lost.
